PowWows.com was started in 1996 by a gentleman who as a graduate student wanted to teach himself HTML.  I thought it would be fun to test this page partly because of why it was made, but also because this is a wonderful resource for all things Native American culture.  Today in this modern age we are largely invisible and easily overlooked, but websites like this one help everyone to learn about Native culture and to see that we are still here.  I did find a number of bugs, but nothing that made the user experience difficult, or made me not want to use this website.  I will keep coming back here not just for finding Pow Wows in my area, but for shopping, recipes, and Native news as well.
